my-codeigniter-first-blog
=========================

Here's my attempts to learn codeigniter via writing the Blog with the custom functions.

REQUIREMENTS:
php5/MYSQL

The next achievements after a week ago:
~~ authorization ~~
~~ connected upload and posts ~~
- purely editable, added and remove features
~~ export file feature ~~

In the next plans are:
- to create strict structure of the application
- implement sass/compass/haml
- play around with the jquery ajax, calendar, another classes
- enough well playing with the Active Record API, good knowledge
- write the users registration
- implement notify emails system with the html content (a set of the letters)

Hopefully will do in a week. Good luck for me!

Cheers.
